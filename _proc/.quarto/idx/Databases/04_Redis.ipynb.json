Redis is known for its high performance, scalability, and simplicity.","output-file":"redis.html","skip_exec":true,"skip_showdoc":true,"title":"Redis"},"headingText":"1. **Core Features of Redis**","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n\n<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->\n\n\n#### a. **In-Memory Data Store**\nRedis is primarily an in-memory store, meaning it holds the entire dataset in memory (RAM), making data access extremely fast. You can optionally persist the data to disk, but it's designed to perform as an in-memory database.\n\n#### b. **Data Structures Supported**\nRedis supports a variety of data structures:\n- **Strings**: The most basic Redis value, strings are binary-safe and can store any type of data (e.g., text, numbers, or serialized data).\n- **Lists**: Ordered collections of strings. Redis lists are ideal for queues or stacks.\n- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique strings.\n- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets, but each member has a score that determines the order.\n- **Hashes**: Key-value pairs within a single key. Perfect for representing objects.\n- **Bitmaps**: Efficient way to store binary data (bits).\n- **HyperLogLog**: Probabilistic data structure used for approximating the cardinality of large datasets.\n- **Streams**: Log-like append-only data structures for time-ordered events.\n- **Geospatial**: Stores and queries geographical data such as longitude and latitude.\n\n#### c. **Persistence Options**\nRedis provides two persistence mechanisms:\n- **RDB (Redis Database Backup)**: Snapshot-based persistence, saving the dataset to disk at regular intervals.\n- **AOF (Append-Only File)**: Logs each write operation to disk, allowing more fine-grained persistence. AOF provides more durability but can be slower than RDB.\n- **Hybrid Persistence**: You can combine both RDB and AOF persistence for balance between performance and durability.\n\n#### d. **Replication**\nRedis supports master-slave replication. You can configure Redis instances as read replicas, which can help distribute the read load and provide high availability.\n\n- **Master/Slave Replication**: Replicas are exact copies of the master. You can have multiple read-only replicas, but only the master can accept write operations.\n- **Asynchronous Replication**: Replication is asynchronous, meaning the master doesn’t wait for replicas to confirm receipt of updates.\n  \n#### e. **High Availability with Redis Sentinel**\nRedis Sentinel provides high availability by monitoring Redis instances and automatically failing over if the master goes down. Sentinel provides:\n- Automatic failover to a replica when the master fails.\n- Monitoring of master and replica instances.\n- Notifications when issues occur.\n\n#### f. **Clustering**\nRedis Cluster allows you to partition data across multiple Redis nodes. It enables Redis to handle larger datasets beyond the memory limit of a single machine and provides data replication and automatic failover.\n\n- **Sharding**: Data is split across multiple nodes based on the hash of the key.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Redis Cluster has built-in mechanisms for fault tolerance, automatically promoting replicas if a master node goes down.\n\n#### g. **Pub/Sub Messaging**\nRedis provides a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging system, allowing messages to be broadcasted to multiple subscribers.\n\n#### h. **Lua Scripting**\nRedis allows you to run Lua scripts atomically, meaning all commands in a script are executed in a single operation. Lua scripts are useful for reducing the number of network round-trips and for executing multiple operations that must be done atomically.\n\n### 2. **Installation and Configuration**\n\n#### a. **Installing Redis**\nYou can install Redis on most operating systems using package managers or by compiling it from source.\n\nFor Ubuntu/Debian:\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install redis-server\n```\n\nFor macOS (using Homebrew):\n```bash\nbrew install redis\n```\n\n#### b. **Starting Redis**\nStart Redis using the command:\n```bash\nredis-server\n```\n\nYou can also configure Redis to run as a service:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable redis-server\nsudo systemctl start redis-server\n```\n\n#### c. **Basic Configuration**\nThe configuration file is typically located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf`. You can configure various aspects of Redis here, such as:\n- **Memory Limits**: Use the `maxmemory` directive to limit how much RAM Redis can use.\n- **Persistence**: Control how often Redis snapshots data using the `save` directive or configure AOF with `appendonly yes`.\n- **Security**: Use `requirepass` to set a password, or configure Redis to listen only on localhost for better security.\n\n### 3. **Redis Data Types and Commands**\n\n#### a. **String Commands**\n```bash\nSET key value     # Set a key to hold the string value\nGET key           # Get the value of a key\nINCR key          # Increment the integer value of a key\nAPPEND key value  # Append a value to a key\nDEL key           # Delete a key\n```\n\n#### b. **List Commands**\n```bash\nRPUSH key value    # Push a value onto the list (right)\nLPUSH key value    # Push a value onto the list (left)\nLRANGE key 0 -1    # Get all elements in the list\nLPOP key           # Remove and return the first element\nRPOP key           # Remove and return the last element\n```\n\n#### c. **Set Commands**\n```bash\nSADD key member     # Add a member to the set\nSMEMBERS key        # Get all members of the set\nSREM key member     # Remove a member from the set\nSISMEMBER key member # Check if a member exists in the set\n```\n\n#### d. **Sorted Set Commands**\n```bash\nZADD key score member  # Add a member to the sorted set with a score\nZRANGE key 0 -1        # Get all elements in the sorted set by score\nZREM key member        # Remove a member from the sorted set\n```\n\n#### e. **Hash Commands**\n```bash\nHSET key field value   # Set a field in the hash\nHGET key field         # Get the value of a field in the hash\nHGETALL key            # Get all fields and values in the hash\nHDEL key field         # Delete a field in the hash\n```\n\n#### f. **Pub/Sub Commands**\n```bash\nPUBLISH channel message   # Publish a message to a channel\nSUBSCRIBE channel         # Subscribe to a channel\n```\n\n#### g. **Stream Commands**\n```bash\nXADD mystream * key value  # Add an entry to a stream\nXRANGE mystream - +        # Get all entries in the stream\nXREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream  # Read from the stream\n```\n\n#### h. **Transaction Commands**\nTransactions in Redis are achieved using `MULTI` and `EXEC` commands.\n```bash\nMULTI                  # Start a transaction\nSET key value          # Queue this command\nINCR key               # Queue another command\nEXEC                   # Execute all queued commands atomically\n```\n\n### 4. **Persistence Options in Redis**\n\n#### a. **RDB (Redis Database Backup)**\nRDB snapshots the dataset at regular intervals and saves it to disk in a binary format. You configure this in `redis.conf` using the `save` directive.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nsave 900 1   # Save every 15 minutes if at least 1 change was made\nsave 300 10  # Save every 5 minutes if at least 10 changes were made\nsave 60 10000 # Save every minute if 10,000 changes were made\n```\n\n#### b. **AOF (Append-Only File)**\nAOF logs every write operation to disk. It offers more durability compared to RDB, as it logs every change.\n\nEnable AOF in `redis.conf`:\n```bash\nappendonly yes\n```\n\nYou can also configure how often the file is synced to disk:\n- `appendfsync always`: Slowest but safest (syncs after every write).\n- `appendfsync everysec`: Recommended (syncs every second).\n- `appendfsync no`: Fastest but less durable.\n\n#### c. **Hybrid Persistence**\nRedis 6 introduced hybrid persistence, which combines both RDB and AOF for better performance and durability. It writes the RDB snapshot to disk, followed by AOF to replay recent operations.\n\n### 5. **Replication and High Availability**\n\n#### a. **Master-Slave Replication**\nYou can replicate data from a master Redis instance to one or more slave instances. This helps distribute the read load across multiple instances.\n\nTo set up a replica, add the following to the `redis.conf` file of the replica:\n\n```bash\nreplicaof <master-ip> <master-port>\n```\n\n#### b. **Redis Sentinel**\nRedis Sentinel is used for automatic failover in a master-slave setup. Sentinel monitors your Redis instances and promotes a slave to master if the master fails.\n\nSentinel runs as a separate process. To configure Sentinel:\n\n```bash\nsentinel monitor mymaster <master-ip> <master-port> 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 60000\n```\n\n#### c. **Redis Cluster**\nRedis Cluster allows you to distribute your dataset across multiple Redis nodes, enabling horizontal scalability. It automatically shards data across nodes using a key hashing algorithm.\n\nTo start a cluster, you need at\n\n least 3 master nodes and preferably 3 replica nodes for failover. You can use the `redis-cli` tool to create a cluster:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:7000 127.0.0.1:7001 127.0.0.1:7002 --cluster-replicas 1\n```\n\n### 6. **Security in Redis**\n\nRedis does not have robust security mechanisms built-in, so securing Redis should be part of your deployment process:\n\n- **Bind to localhost or private network**:\n  In `redis.conf`, set `bind 127.0.0.1` to limit connections to localhost.\n\n- **Require Password**:\n  Use the `requirepass` directive in `redis.conf` to enforce password authentication:\n  ```bash\n  requirepass your-password-here\n  ```\n\n- **Disable Command Renaming**:\n  To prevent misuse of dangerous commands (like `FLUSHALL`), you can rename or disable them:\n  ```bash\n  rename-command FLUSHALL \"\"\n  ```\n\n- **Use TLS**:\n  Redis 6.0 and above support TLS encryption, which secures data transmitted over the network. You can enable TLS using the following settings in `redis.conf`:\n  ```bash\n  tls-port 6379\n  tls-cert-file /path/to/your/cert.pem\n  tls-key-file /path/to/your/key.pem\n  tls-ca-cert-file /path/to/your/ca.pem\n  ```\n\n### 7. **Advanced Features**\n\n#### a. **Lua Scripting**\nRedis allows you to run Lua scripts atomically, making them ideal for performing complex operations involving multiple keys.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nEVAL \"return redis.call('GET', KEYS[1])\" 1 mykey\n```\n\n- The `EVAL` command is used to execute the Lua script.\n- `KEYS[1]` represents the first key passed to the script.\n\n#### b. **Bitmaps**\nBitmaps are used to store binary data in Redis. You can set or get bits at specific offsets.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nSETBIT mykey 7 1       # Set the 7th bit of mykey to 1\nGETBIT mykey 7         # Get the value of the 7th bit\nBITCOUNT mykey         # Count the number of bits set to 1\n```\n\n#### c. **HyperLogLog**\nHyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure for estimating the cardinality of large datasets.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nPFADD mylog value1 value2 value3\nPFCOUNT mylog    # Get the approximate number of unique elements\n```\n\n#### d. **Streams**\nStreams allow you to create logs of data, which can be processed by consumers in real-time.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nXADD mystream * field1 value1 field2 value2   # Add an entry to the stream\nXREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS mystream 0              # Read two entries from the stream\n```\n\n### 8. **Redis Use Cases**\n\n- **Caching**: Redis is commonly used for caching web pages, session data, and database query results due to its high performance and TTL features.\n- **Real-Time Analytics**: Use Redis for real-time metrics aggregation and reporting.\n- **Message Queues**: Redis Pub/Sub and Lists can be used for lightweight messaging and task queues.\n- **Leaderboards**: Sorted sets in Redis are perfect for building leaderboards in gaming and other applications.\n- **Session Store**: Redis is often used to store user session data because of its in-memory speed and ability to expire keys.\n\n### 9. **Monitoring Redis**\n\nYou can monitor Redis using several methods:\n\n- **Redis INFO Command**: Provides real-time metrics such as memory usage, client connections, and keyspace statistics.\n  ```bash\n  redis-cli INFO\n  ```\n\n- **Redis CLI MONITOR Command**: This command shows real-time queries executed by Redis.\n  ```bash\n  redis-cli MONITOR\n  ```\n\n- **Third-Party Tools**: Tools like **RedisInsight**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana** provide a more detailed dashboard for Redis monitoring.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED!
