    "### 1. **What are Managers in Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **manager** in Django is the interface through which **database query operations** are provided to Django models. Every model in Django has at least one manager, and by default, Django provides a `Manager` object called `objects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Default Manager**\n",
    "By default, every model has a manager named `objects`, which allows you to interact with the model’s database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example model\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the default manager to query the database\n",
    "books = Book.objects.all()  # Retrieves all books\n",
    "book = Book.objects.get(id=1)  # Retrieves a specific book by ID\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Custom Manager**\n",
    "You can create a custom manager to encapsulate logic specific to your model, allowing for more readable and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom manager\n",
    "class BookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def published_last_year(self):\n",
    "        last_year = timezone.now().year - 1\n",
    "        return self.filter(published_date__year=last_year)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a custom manager\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    objects = BookManager()  # Use the custom manager\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. **Creating Custom Managers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Django allows you to define custom managers to encapsulate common queries, making your code more modular and readable. A custom manager can be defined by subclassing `models.Manager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Basic Custom Manager**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PublishedBookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def get_queryset(self):\n",
    "        # Override the default get_queryset method to return only published books\n",
    "        return super().get_queryset().filter(published_date__isnull=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the custom manager in a model\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Define two managers: a default manager and a custom manager\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedBookManager()  # Custom manager for published books\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Book.objects.all()` will return all books.\n",
    "- `Book.published.all()` will return only books that have a `published_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Multiple Managers**\n",
    "You can define multiple managers in a single model to access different sets of query logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Default and custom managers\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedBookManager()  # Custom manager\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Manager Methods**: Manager methods are useful when you want to return data that does not require chaining or modifying the base QuerySet.\n",
    "- **QuerySet Methods**: QuerySet methods are ideal when you want to create reusable filtering logic that can be chained with other QuerySet methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Each:\n",
    "- Use **manager methods** when the method represents an action that doesn’t require chaining (e.g., creating objects or counting objects).\n",
    "- Use **custom QuerySet methods** when you want to filter or manipulate a set of results and keep the option of chaining other QuerySet methods."

    "#### b. **Use `get_queryset()` Wisely**\n",
    "Always return a `QuerySet` from the `get_queryset()` method, as it allows you to further modify the query (e.g., chaining filters, ordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Leverage Lazy Evaluation**\n",
    "Django QuerySets are lazily evaluated, so you can build complex queries without immediately hitting the database. However, ensure queries are evaluated efficiently by minimizing unnecessary evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Avoid Logic in Views**\n",
    "Instead of placing filtering and querying logic in views, use custom managers or QuerySets to encapsulate and reuse this logic across your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. **Chaining Queries**\n",
    "When creating custom QuerySet methods, ensure they return a QuerySet so that you can continue to chain additional filters and operations."
