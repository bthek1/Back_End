    "### 1. **What are Managers in Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **manager** in Django is the interface through which **database query operations** are provided to Django models. Every model in Django has at least one manager, and by default, Django provides a `Manager` object called `objects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Default Manager**\n",
    "By default, every model has a manager named `objects`, which allows you to interact with the modelâ€™s database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example model\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the default manager to query the database\n",
    "books = Book.objects.all()  # Retrieves all books\n",
    "book = Book.objects.get(id=1)  # Retrieves a specific book by ID\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Custom Manager**\n",
    "You can create a custom manager to encapsulate logic specific to your model, allowing for more readable and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom manager\n",
    "class BookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def published_last_year(self):\n",
    "        last_year = timezone.now().year - 1\n",
    "        return self.filter(published_date__year=last_year)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a custom manager\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    objects = BookManager()  # Use the custom manager\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. **Creating Custom Managers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Django allows you to define custom managers to encapsulate common queries, making your code more modular and readable. A custom manager can be defined by subclassing `models.Manager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Basic Custom Manager**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PublishedBookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def get_queryset(self):\n",
    "        # Override the default get_queryset method to return only published books\n",
    "        return super().get_queryset().filter(published_date__isnull=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the custom manager in a model\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Define two managers: a default manager and a custom manager\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedBookManager()  # Custom manager for published books\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Book.objects.all()` will return all books.\n",
    "- `Book.published.all()` will return only books that have a `published_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Multiple Managers**\n",
    "You can define multiple managers in a single model to access different sets of query logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Default and custom managers\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedBookManager()  # Custom manager\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Manager Methods**: Manager methods are useful when you want to return data that does not require chaining or modifying the base QuerySet.\n",
    "- **QuerySet Methods**: QuerySet methods are ideal when you want to create reusable filtering logic that can be chained with other QuerySet methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Each:\n",
    "- Use **manager methods** when the method represents an action that doesnâ€™t require chaining (e.g., creating objects or counting objects).\n",
    "- Use **custom QuerySet methods** when you want to filter or manipulate a set of results and keep the option of chaining other QuerySet methods."

    "Encapsulate complex queries or business logic inside custom managers and QuerySets to make your views and templates cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Use `get_queryset()` Wisely**\n",
    "Always return a `QuerySet` from the `get_queryset()` method, as it allows you to further modify the query (e.g., chaining filters, ordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Leverage Lazy Evaluation**\n",
    "Django QuerySets are lazily evaluated, so you can build complex queries without immediately hitting the database. However, ensure queries are evaluated efficiently by minimizing unnecessary evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Avoid Logic in Views**\n",
    "Instead of placing filtering and querying logic in views, use custom managers or QuerySets to encapsulate and reuse this logic across your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. **Chaining Queries**\n",
    "When creating custom QuerySet methods, ensure they return a QuerySet so that you can continue to chain additional filters and operations."
