    "## 🔹 What is DuckDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In-process OLAP database**: It runs inside your application (like SQLite) but is optimized for **analytics queries** (OLAP), not transactional workloads (OLTP).\n",
    "* **Zero-config**: No server to spin up, no dependencies. You just `import duckdb` and start querying.\n",
    "* **Columnar engine**: Uses a column-store format with vectorized execution, making it blazing fast for aggregation and scanning large datasets.\n",
    "* **Modern SQL dialect**: Full SQL support (joins, windows, CTEs, JSON, UDFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---"

    "## 🔹 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reads CSV, Parquet, JSON, SQLite, Pandas, Polars, Arrow, Iceberg, MotherDuck (cloud).\n",
    "* Can **query files directly** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM 'file.parquet'`).\n",
    "* Can query **in-memory dataframes** without copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vectorized execution**: Processes chunks of columns in CPU cache.\n",
    "* **Parallelism**: Multithreaded query execution.\n",
    "* **Efficient compression**: Similar to Parquet, built for scan speed.\n",
    "* Benchmarks show it often beats Pandas/Polars for SQL-style analytics on millions-to-billions of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python / R / C++ / CLI** bindings.\n",
    "* Native support for **Pandas/Polars ↔ DuckDB** interchange.\n",
    "* Can be used as a lightweight ETL or embedded query layer inside ML pipelines.\n",
    "* **dbt + DuckDB** is popular for lightweight data warehousing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **SQL Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries.\n",
    "* JSON functions (`json_extract`, `json_group_array`).\n",
    "* User-defined functions in Python.\n",
    "* Time-travel style queries with Iceberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Default is **in-memory**, but you can `duckdb.connect(\"file.duckdb\")` to persist.\n",
    "* Tables can be **native DuckDB storage** or **external (Parquet, CSV, Arrow)**.\n",
    "* **No server process**: library embedded in your app.\n",
